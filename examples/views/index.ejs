<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to make XMPP really simple to use for developers. This module takes 
away all of the XML and works by hooking to events which are passed between client and server 
using a transport in JSON. In the example code we use socket.io, but there is no reason this 
can not be replaced with engine.io, or implement your own transport and pass in as a connection.</p>

<p>The examples on this site use <a href="http://socket.io" target="_blank">socket.io</a> to handle 
data transport and will attempt to use websockets before attempting to use alternative connection types.</p>
